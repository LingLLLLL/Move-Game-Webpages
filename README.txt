Team 5 Co. is a hobby club that specializes in selling books, movies, and video games to its members at half the market price. Our team developed an e-commerce website for Team 5 Co. members to access these products. In order to access all the pages, users need to log in or sign up by providing their personal information such as their first and last name, email address, and password. If you are not login successfully, it will give you an alert, but you still have access to all the pages.
Once logged in, users are directed to the home page featuring a Chinese MMORPG game background. From here, users can select product categories from the dropdown menu in the header. Clicking on a category will display all the products available under that category. Users can add products to their cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button, and the number of items in the cart will be displayed on the white cart icon in the header.
Clicking on the white cart icon will direct users to the checkout page where they can review the product list, edit the quantity of items by clicking the up and down arrow next to the number, and remove unwanted items. The total cost of the items, including taxes, is calculated and displayed below the checkout list. Users must enter their billing and shipping information before clicking on the "Continue to checkout" button to complete the purchase. If any required fields are left empty, an alert will prompt users to fill in the missing information.
